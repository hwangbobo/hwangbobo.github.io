## About

I am a rising senior at New York University Abu Dhabi, studying Economics and
Sociology with a minor in Mathematics. I found myself intrigued by data-driven
approaches to social issues & applications of social statistics after taking
Data Analysis course at college.


My college track was been pretty leeway, but happy with where I've come so far.
When I am not doing college or work-related stuffs, I can be found making
hand-drip coffee, traveling, writing blog posts (Korean & English), or spending
time doing with my little sister.
