## About

I am a rising senior at [New York University Abu Dhabi][nyuad-link], studying Economics and
Sociology with a minor in Mathematics. I am intrigued by data-driven
approaches to social issues & applications of social statistics, which led to my work in both academic research and tech company settings. Eventually, I hope to combine my interests in tech and society to apply computational tools in understanding social issues better.

When I am not doing college or work-related stuffs, I can be found making
hand-drip coffee, traveling, writing blog posts (Korean & English), or spending
time playing with my little sister.
