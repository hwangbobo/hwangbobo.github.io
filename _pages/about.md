## About

I am a rising senior at [New York University Abu Dhabi][nyuad-link], studying Economics and
Sociology with a minor in Mathematics. I found myself intrigued by data-driven
approaches to social issues & applications of social statistics after taking
Data Analysis course at college. Previously, I have engaged in both academic research and tech field and hope to combine my interests in computational tools to better understand social issues

- Interests: Social Networks, Social dynamics in tech sphere


My college track was been pretty leeway, but happy with where I've come so far.
When I am not doing college or work-related stuffs, I can be found making
hand-drip coffee, traveling, writing blog posts (Korean & English), or spending
time playing with my little sister.
